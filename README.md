# SmartCardToolkit

Small command line utility that transforms easy to remember commands to their equivalent hex strings that the smart card can understand and perform all the necessary cryptographic operations.

Developed for a assignment of the Identification and Authentication subject in the UC3M's Cybersecurity masters, not for much use for anything else.
